# ARC Repository Example
Example Github Repository for ARC Autonomous Portion

File structure must be of the following:
- Code: Contains any code that is to be run by judges
- Supporting Material: Anything that can help judges understand what code is doing

In the code folder, there are two files: main.py and example.py. Teams must NOT modify main.py except areas that are denoted (importing functions, etc.) and are only allowed to use libraries that are imported there.

Main.py:
- This will be the script that will be run by the judges. Libraries that are available to teams are imported there in main.py. Teams can modify areas not marked as "DO NOT EDIT", and teams will be penalized if those portions are modified. 

Example.py:
- This script shows an example file that programs the quadcopter to flies through all the waypoints in the order that it is listed before landing. This script satisfies all the requirements listed in the rulebook: computing, generating the 3D flight path, and flying the Tello drone.
